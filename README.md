# FHMWG Stage 1 Recommendations

Stage 1 of the Family History MEtadata Working Group (FHMWG) standards process is the drafting of recommendations about the use of existing metadata tags for family history purposes.

- The current draft, which was discussed and approved by the FHMWG and is believed to be final,
    is in [stage1-draft2.md](blob/master/stage1-draft2.md).
- A technical summary of that draft
    is in [stage1-overview.md](blob/master/stage1-overview.md)
- A reference public-domain implementation using the Adobe XMP Toolkit
    can be found in the [cpp-code repository](/fhmwg/cpp-code)

FHMWG has a larger mission, but this initial project is limited to the use of existing photo embedded metatdata tags.

# Stage 2 and Beyond

The FHMWG interim board has determined that there should be a period of time in which the stage 1 recommendations are championed and disseminated before beginning to specify stage 2 recommendations.
The stage 1 recommendation draft does contain some indication of known weaknesses in the specification that may be addressed in later stages, but a schedule for the beginning of stage two has not yet been announced.
