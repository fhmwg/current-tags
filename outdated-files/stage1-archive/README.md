# FHMWG Stage 1 Recommendations

Stage 1 of the Family History Metadata Working Group (FHMWG) standards process is the drafting of recommendations about the use of existing metadata tags for family history purposes.

- The stage 1 recommendations were discussed and approved by the FHMWG and are believed to be final;
    they may be found in [stage1.md](stage1.md).
- A technical summary of that recommendations
    is in [stage1-overview.md](stage1-overview.md)
- A reference public-domain implementation using the Adobe XMP Toolkit
    can be found in the [cpp-code repository](https://github.com/fhmwg/cpp-code)

FHMWG has a larger mission, but this initial project is limited to the use of existing photo embedded metadata tags.
See <https://fhmwg.org/> for more about the FHMWG

# Stage 2 and Beyond

The FHMWG interim board has determined that there should be a period of time in which the stage 1 recommendations are championed and disseminated before beginning to specify stage 2 recommendations.
The stage 1 recommendation draft does contain some indication of known weaknesses in the recommendation that may be addressed in later stages, but a schedule for the beginning of stage 2 has not yet been announced.
