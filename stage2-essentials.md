# 1. Overarching Principles   <a name="1"></a>

All FHMWG recommendations relate to reading and writing [XMP-encoded metadata](https://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp.html) and syncing semantically equalivent data with IIM and EXIF data for optimum interoperability.
Within XMP, many FHMWG recommendations are aligned with the [IPTC standard](https://iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/iptc-standard/).
We also endorse IPTC's guidelines for [Interoperabilty]() and [Mapping]().

## 1.1. Datatypes   <a name="1.1"></a>

XMP Data Types:

The [XMP Specificaiton](https://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp.html) defines core and derived datatypes in [Part 1, Data model, Serialization, and Core Properties](https://github.com/adobe/XMP-Toolkit-SDK/blob/main/docs/XMPSpecificationPart1.pdf) 

XMP Specification Part 1 defines core the following value types in section 8.2
Boolean
Date
Integer
Real
Text

XMP Derived Value Types are defined in section 8.2.2


**Language Alternative**: An XMP datatype that contains an alternative array of simple text items with an xml:lang qualifier that identifies the language.  The language tag value adheres to the BCP 47 spec. (XMP Specification says IETF RFC 3066 which was superseeded by [RCF 4647]https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc4647 and is included in [BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc4647). See also wikipedias' article [IETF Language Tag](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc4647).

The Langague Alternative derived data type is a core Text with an xml:lang qualifier that identifies the language of the text.  If the language is not known, an xml:lang qualifier of "x-default" can be used instead of a specific language.  Notably, XMP does not use the BCP 47 standard `i-default` language subtag. It is recommended that every Language Alternative property have an `x-default` entry for compatibility.

The first item in the array is the default item. In addition, if you know the language, add the language-specific alternate value.  

The intent of the language alternative is to allow translated strings to be embedded in the metadata.  For personal family history photos, the language and translated strings may not be important.  However, if the photo is uploaded to a website that includes multiple languages, the website may need to know what language is in the string to index and search it correctly.  For this reason, including the language-specific alternative in addition to the "x-default" item is recommended. Including a list of translated strings for the language alternative data type is out of scope for this recommendation.

**URI**: Text denoting an Internet Uniform Resource Identifier as defined in [IETF RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3986) A URI can be a locator, a name, or both.

XMP Basic Value Types are defined in section 8.2.1 and serialiation for unicode is covered in section 7.1

**Text**: A possibly empty Unicode string. The XMP specification does not dictate the Unicode encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32), but is left up to the reader.  XMP readers should recognize and honor a leading Unicode U+FEFF character as a byte-order marker. A writing using UTF-16 or UTF-32 should include a leading Unicode U+FEFF character.  An XMP writer UTF8 may use a leading U+FEEFF character, but it is not recommended.




## 1.2. Do not remove metadata   <a name="1.2"></a>

An application shall not remove a metadata field simply because it does not understand the meaning of the field.
All metadata, understood or not, shall be preserved unless it violates an application's code of conduct.

Applications must not edit provided metadata except under the following three cases:

1. User-moderated editing is permitted, including
    1. user-initiated edits and
    2. application-initiated edits presented to the user for approval.
2. Converting non-IRI values to unicode normal forms C or D.
3. Other cases specifically permitted for a particular field or datatype.

Applications may remove a metadata field entirely if it violates an application's code of conduct and no edit is permitted under the three cases above.
Note that removing a field is distinct from editing it to be the empty string: removing a field means removing its XMP element or EXIF key:value pair entirely.

## 1.3. Selective Implementation   <a name="1.3"></a>

If
- a user provides additional metadata about an image, and
- the metadata provided is of a type covered in this recommendation, and
- the user does not request that the metadata be kept private

then a compliant application shall embed the metadata in the image upon export as specified in this document.

It is not necessary for an application to handle all of the metadata discussed in this recommendation to be considered compliant with these recommendations.
An application that does not handle metadata at all, neither accepting nor removing it, is trivially compliant.
An application that only tags the names of individuals in a photo and has no other metadata is compliant if it embeds that metadata according to the Person section and does not otherwise edit or remove metadata.
Etc.

## 1.4. Going beyond this spec   <a name="1.4"></a>

Applications may implement metadata beyond the scope of this recommendation, either by implementing other metadata standards or by designing their own metadata system.
Note, however, that metadata that is covered by these recommendations must be embedded according to them, even if it is also embedded in additional ways.

## 1.5 Metadata Interoperability

XMP data is the top level data and is the data written and read.  Semantically equivalent fields in whatever format (XMP, IIM, EXIF) should be kept in sync with the XMP data. When reading metadata XMP properties should be consulted first, then IIM data, and then EXIF data. This allows older applications and embedded metadata to interoperate with the family history data that the user provides.  

## 1.6 Technical Conflicts
The FHMWG recommendations are provided to promote interoperability and best practices.  The recommendations should fall within the framework of the various metadata standards, however, if any of the FHMWG recommendations are in direct technical conflict with any of the underlying standards (XMP, IPTC, IIM, EXIF), the standards prevail.  

# 2. Metadata to Write   <a name="2"></a>

This section uses the following prefixes for XMP namespaces:

| Prefix        | URI                                                        |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dc`          | `http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/`                         |
| `exif`        | `http://ns.adobe.com/exif/1.0/`                            |
| `Iptc4xmpExt` | `http://iptc.org/std/Iptc4xmpExt/2008-02-29/`              |
| `mwg-rs`      | `http://www.metadataworkinggroup.com/schemas/regions/`     |
| `photoshop`   | `http://ns.adobe.com/photoshop/1.0/`                       |
| `rdf`         | `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#`              |
| `stArea`      | `http://ns.adobe.com/xmp/sTypeArea#`                       |

Exiftool provides handles that provide a flattened name and a family group.  In addition to the -G option that shows which technology the metadata is using (EXIF, IPTC/IIM, XMP), the -G0:1 option provides a second family group in addition to the technology group which may be helpful in verifying the metadata written.  The IPTC group that is the IIM data does not have a second group.  EXIF has GPS and IFD0.  XMP has XMP-iptcCore, XMP-iptcExt, XMP-dc, XMP-mwg-rs, and XMP-photoshop. This more detailed documentation also provides the exiftool Family Group 1 tag that indicates the XMP namespace along with the technology family group.  For example using the -G0:1 option and looking at the XMP title property, would include both groups in the output as XMP:XMP-dc.  

## 2.1. Title   <a name="2.1"></a>

Reference:  [IPTC Core 7.25. Title](https://iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata#title)  

An image may have a title.  The title should be a short human-readable name or reference for the digital file.

The title field is intended to be short and displayable as a line of text in most user interfaces. Longer information should be placed in the description field instead. If the title is longer than an application displays, the application may display a prefix of the title with an indicator that the title has been truncated for display. Note this truncation is for display only: implementations must not truncate existing longer titles upon export.

### 2.1.1 Title Metadata to Write  <a name="2.1.1"></a>

| Property             | XMP Spec | Data Type <Cardinality> | Exiftool Handle | Stores |
| :------------------- | :---     | :-----                 | :-----          |:---|

Optional semantically equivalent IIM field to sync with Title:

| Optional field   | Specification | Exiftool Handle |
| :------------------- | :--- | :----- |
| `IIM:ObjectName` | 2:05 Object Name |IPTC:ObjectName |

### 2.1.2 Title Metadata to Read <a name="2.1.2"><a/>
If `dc:title` is not present,  these optional semantically equivalent fields may be consulted: 

| Property | Specification |
| :---- | :--- |
| IIM Object Name| 2:05 Object Name|

Note: Although the [IPTC Interoperability Test](https://getpmd.iptc.org/interoptests-iptcpmd.html) will flag the Title as "Not in Sync" if the Title and IIM field are not the same, FHWMG is not currently requiring the sync.

## 2.2. Description   <a name="2.2"></a>

Reference:  [IPTC Core 7.11. Description](https://iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata#description)  

An image may have a description.

The description may be of any length and contain any information the user cares to add. The description could also include a caption for the image.

FHMWG-recommended description may containing any information the description-writer wishes to add. The intent is to capture any metadata that other structured metadata fields cannot.
It does not store structured information. Where possible, implementations should encourage placing information in the other structured metadata fields in addition to the description.

It is common for descriptions to replicate some information included elsewhere in the metadata.  Since the description is generally searchable by most applications, users may want to include dates, locations, and people in a non-structured format in the desription as well as in the appropriate structured fields.  

For example, peopled portrayed in the image may be identified in person meatadata and also in the description so that the people in the photo are more widely searchable.  Most applications will search the desription, but not all applications search the person metadata.

This inevitably leads to the possibility of conflicting information. Because it is not possible to programmatically determine which metadata is most accurate, implementations should display all metadata to the user and not attempt to perform automated resolution of conflicts between descriptions and other metadata.

### 2.2.1. Writing Descrirpiton Metadata   <a name="2.2.1"></a>


| Property             | XMP Spec | Data Type <Cardinality> | Exiftool Handle | Stores |
| :------------------- | :---     | :-----                | :---            |:--- |
| Iptc4xmpCore:Description| dc:Description | Language Alternative <0..1> |XMP:Description  | Image description |

Optional semantically equivalent IIM and EXIF fields to sync with Description

| Optional Property | Specification |Exiftool Handle |
| :---- | :--- | :----- |
| `IIM:Caption-Abstract` | 2:120 Caption-Abstract | IPTC:Caption-Abstract|
| `EXIF:ImageDescription` | 270/0x010E ImageDescription | EXIF:ImageDescription|

Note:  Although the [IPTC Interoperability Test](https://getpmd.iptc.org/interoptests-iptcpmd.html) will flag Description as "Not in Sync" if IIM 2:120 Caption/Abstract is missing, FHMWG is not currently requiring this sync.

### 2.2.2 Reading Description Metadata

If  `dc:description` is not present, the following optional semantically equivalent fields maby be consulted in this order:

| Property | Specification |
| :---- | :--- |
| IIM Caption/Abstract| 2:120 Caption/Abstract|
| EXIF Image Descritpion | 270/0x010E ImageDescription | 

#### 2.2.3. Description XMP Example   <a name="2.2.3"></a>

#### 2.2.5.2  IPTC Guidelines for Mapping Description to EXIF and IIM

### 2.2.6 Other Considerations for Description Metadata  <a name="2.2.6"></a>

IPTC also defines `photoshop:CaptionWriter`, which may be useful for applications that wish to record who authored a description. Note, however, that `photoshop:CaptionWriter` is limited to a single name. The FHMWG is not aware of any existing metadata suitable for storing the contributions of multiple metadata authors and editors.

There is a known desire to store the following captions types separately:

- caption as written on image
- printed caption accompanying image
- caption supplied by user of digital tool

There is a known desire to store the authorship and edit dates of all captions. `photoshop:CaptionWriter` may provide a partial solution to this.

There is a known desire to include style markup in captions. Embedded HTML may be a solution to this, but is not directly permitted as part of XMP and raises issues about validation and markup-unaware implementations.

There is a known desire to include links between portions of captions and other metadata fields. RDFa and xlink may provide a solution to this, but are quite heavy-handed.

## 2.3. Date   <a name="2.3"></a>

Reference:  [IPTC Core 7.10. Date Created](https://iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata#date-created)

If there is any discrepancy between the summary data below and the IPTC Core reference above, the IPTC documentation prevails.

An image can record the date of the depicted scene. The precision and accuracy of the date may vary, e.g. the date may only be specified by a year, or a month within a year, etc.

Note that this is the date of the scene depicted in the image, and may not be the date of the image’s creation. While the depicted date and the creation date may be the same for digital photographs, they generally differ for scanned images or artistic representations.

Many other date fields exist in other metadata, such as file creation and modification dates, copyright dates, etc. As with all metadata, implementations may choose to support those if they wish, but this recommendation only addresses the date of the depicted scene. 

User interfaces should make clear that this is not an image modification date: it is the date of the depicted scene.  

XMP recommends recording times using timezone offsets, as that provides more information than converting to UTC.

The user interface for entering dates should support providing partial dates, such as year only or year and month only. 

When syncing data to IIM:DateTimeCreated, the date should also be truncated, however, EXIF:DateTimeOriginal does not support truncated date and a full date must be supplied.  When writing the date created as EXIF data, use 01 for the truncated information. Example, if the data is 1830 user 1830 for the XMP property, 1830-00-00 for the IIM property, and 1830-01-01 for the EXIF property.

### 2.3.1. Date Metadata to Write   <a name="2.3.1"></a>
   
|Required Property             | XMP Spec                | Data Type <Cardinality>  | Exiftool Handle              | Stores |
| :-------------------         | :---                    | :-----                   | :---                         |:--- |
| `Iptc4xmpCore:DateCreated`   | `photoshop:DateCreated` | XMP:DateCreated <0..1>   |/[XMP-photoshop:DateCreated/] | Date of depicted scene |

Recommended semantically equivalent IIM and EXIF fields to sync with date created: 

| Optional Property     | Specification | Exiftool Handle |
| :----                 | :---          | :----- |
| `IIM:DateTimeCreated` | 2:55 Date Created + 2:60 Time Created | IPTC:DateCreated & IPTC:TimeCreated |
| `EXIF:DateTimeOriginal` | 0x9003 DateTimeOriginal | EXIF:DateTimeOriginal|

### 2.3.2 Reading Date Metadata
When reading date created metadata, consult the following fields in this order
*XMP:photoshop:dateCreated /[XMP:XMP-photoshop/] DateCreated
*IIM:DateTimeCreated /[IPTC/] DateCreated
*EXIF:DateTimeOriginal /[EXIF:ExifIFD/] DateTimeOriginal

### 2.3.5. Date Details   <a name="2.3.5"></a>

#### 2.3.5.1 XMP Details for Date
XMP photoshop:DateCreated is an XMP Date core value type defined in Section 8.1.1.2 (page 21) of XMP Specification Part 1 as:

A date-time value is represented using a subset of the formats as defined in Date and Time Formats:

YYYY<br>
YYYY-MM<br>
YYYY-MM-DD<br>
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD<br>
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD<br>
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD<br>

In which:
* YYYY = four-digit year
* MM = two-digit month (01=January)
* DD = two-digit day of month (01 to 31)
* hh = two digits of hour (00 to 23)
* mm = two digits of minute (00 to 59)
* ss = two digits of second (00 to 59)
* s = one or more digits representing a decimal fraction of a second
* TZD = time zone designator (Z or +hh:mm or -hh:mm)
  
The time zone designator need not be present in XMP. When not present, the time zone is unknown, and an XMP processor should not assume anything about the missing time zone.

Local time-zone designators +hh:mm or -hh:mm should be used when possible instead of converting to UTC. 

NOTE: If a file was saved at noon on October 23, a timestamp of 2004-10-23T12:00:00-06:00 conveys more information than 2004-10-23T18:00:00Z

[Exif Note on Date Created](https://iptc.org/std/photometadata/documentation/mappingguidelines/#exif-note-on-date-created)

### 2.3.6 Other Considerations for Date Metadata   <a name="2.3.6"></a>

There is a known desire to store date information that XMP's subset of ISO 8601 cannot:

- approximate dates
- date ranges (for depictions of events that covered multiple days)
- dates before 0001-01-01
- dates with time information but without time zone information

## 2.4. Location   <a name="2.4"></a>

References:

[IPTC Extension 11.22. Location Shown in the Image](https://iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata#location-shown-in-the-image)

[IPTC Extension 12.10. Location structure](https://iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata#location-structure)

An image can identify one location where the primary focus of the depicted scene is found. 

A location can have names such as a full name, identifier, sublocation, city, state, country, as well as GPS coordinates. At least one of the location name elements are required. Location identifier and GPS coordinates are optional.

IPTC allows storing more than one location in a single image's metadata. Because the meaning of multiple locations is not uniformly understood, we recommend against using multiple locations.

Many other location properties exist in the IPTC standard. As with all metadata, implementations may choose to support those if they wish, but this recommendation only includes fields in the IPTC locationShownInImage property. Best practices recommend syncing the location elements with the appropriate core XMP properties as well as IIM and EXIF properties.

GPS coordinates always identify a single precise point, but real locations may cover a larger area or be imprecisely located.  The location names can help convey the scope of the GPS coordinates.

The location is stored in a structure that contains a full name for the location, which may contain jurisdictions (such as county) that are not supported in the other jurisdiction name fields.
There is only one location represented in the LocationShownInImage structure, so all the subfields should be consistent.  That is, GPS info, location names, and identifiers should represent the same physical location.
Within the LocationShownInImage structure, a location may be defined by at least one of the following criteria
* the full name of the location in LocationName, 
* at least one of the jurisdictional locations such as sublocation/address, city, state, country, or
* GPS coordinates.

![LocationNamesAndGeotags](https://github.com/fhmwg/current-tags/assets/702496/d4edf519-aac8-4ab7-8644-2c295c0f5f20)

## 2.4.1 Location - Names and Identifier   <a name="2.4"></a>

FamilySearch uses the LocationName and LocationId with its place authority standards. 
If you are not using the LocationName, use the sublocation, city, state, and country fields in the location structure in LocationShownInImage and sync them to the appropriate IIM and EXIF fields.

Required:  In the LocationShownInImage property, the LocationName and/or at least one of Sublocation, City, ProvinceState, and Country fields are required.

Note that `mwg-rs:Title` and `mwg-rs:Description` do not support language tags or AltLangs.

Although Person Face can store all the information that [Person Name](#2.5) stores,
[Person Name](#2.5) is more widely supported;
thus, applications should copy any `mwg-rs:Title` into a `Iptc4xmpExt:PersonInImage`.





# 3. Additional Considerations   <a name="3"></a>

## 3.1. Field-specific recommendations   <a name="3.1"></a>

### 3.1.1. Title   <a name="3.1.1"></a>

The title field is intended to be short and displayable as a line or two of text in most user interfaces. Longer information should be placed in the description field instead. If the title is longer than an application displays, the application may display a prefix of the title with an indicator that the title has been truncated for display. Note this truncation is for display only: implementations must not truncate existing longer titles upon export.

#### 3.1.2.1. Other metadata of interest   <a name="3.1.2.1"></a>

If `dc:title` is not present,  it is recommended that the following semantically equivalent field be consulted: 

| Property | Specification |
| :---- | :--- |
| IIM Object Name| 2:05 Object Name|

Note: Although the [IPTC Interoperability Test](https://getpmd.iptc.org/interoptests-iptcpmd.html) will flag the Title as "Not in Sync" if the Title and IIM field are not the same, FHWMG is not currently requiring the sync.  

#### 3.1.2.2. Example   <a name="3.1.2.2"></a>

### 3.1.3. Date   <a name="3.1.3"></a>



### 3.1.4. Location   <a name="3.1.4"></a>

FHMWG-recommended location metadata stores GPS coordinates of a characteristic point within the depicted scene and a textual description of the location of the depicted scene.
It does not store

- GPS precision
- GPS regions
- Jurisdiction-name-based locations
- A distinction between current and historical location

IPTC clarifies that latitude and longitude are defined per WGS 84 (also called WGS 1984 or EPSG:4326), meaning positive latitudes are north of the equator and positive longitudes are east of the meridian.

Place names generally fit into some kind of jurisdictional hierarchy, but the levels and their names vary by region and change over time. It is recommended that the full place name be given, in smallest to largest region order, with jurisdiction titles and the date at which the names applied, in the free-text "`LocationName`". Specific metadata fields for some jurisdiction types (such as "city" and "state") are provided in some metadata standards, but are inadequate for the general case so the `LocationName` should be used even if those other fields are populated.

Applications should encourage users to use the location description that existed at the time of the depicted event.

IPTC allows image metadata to include more than one location per image.
The FHMWG recommends storing only a single location, which should be the location of the most important depicted elements (generally of the people in the foreground).

GPS coordinates fail to capture that locations may be regions, not points. For example, a picture of the city of Dubai might be coded as being a point in Dubai such as 25.2047397, 55.2707065, even if that specific point (where Al Safa Street crosses over Sheikh Zayed Road) is not visible in the image.

GPS coordinates fail to capture that locations may be approximate. For example, a picture of a headstone in the Sleepy Hollow cemetery in Sleepy Hollow New York may be coded as 41.089715, -73.862005 (the main entrance to the cemetery) if the coordinates of the specific headstone is not known.

The coordinates of a conceptual location change over time by nature of plate tectonics. For example, an earthquake on 11 March 2011 moved portions of Japan 2.4 meters (about 0.000025° longitude) and regions of the sea floor ten times that far. It is generally considered best practice to represent current, not historical, coordinates when possible.

The number of digits provided for a coordinate should not be taken to imply accuracy or region size.

Although IPTC unambiguously defines latitude and longitude to store decimal numbers, several tools instead store them as numbers followed by a letter: `N` or `S` for latitude, `E` or `W` for longitude.
If `N` or `E` is present, it should be discarded; if `S` or `W` is present, it should be removed and the sign of the number flipped.


#### 3.1.4.1. Other metadata of interest   <a name="3.1.4.1"></a>

It is recommended that missing location data be filled in the following order if `Iptc4xmpExt:LocationShown`'s GPS coordinates are missing:

1. geocode `Iptc4xmpExt:LocationShown`'s address components
2. geocode IPTC legacy location fields (`photoshop:City` etc)
3. `Iptc4xmpExt:LocationCreated`'s GPS coordinates
4. geocode `Iptc4xmpExt:LocationCreated`'s address components
5. geocode IPTC IIM address (2:90 city, 2:92 sub-location, 2:95 province/state, etc)
6. EXIF's `GPSLatitude` and `GPSLongitude`, as modified by `GPSLatitudeRef` and `GPSLongitudeRef`

It is recommended that EXIF's GPS coordinates be updated any time the `LocationShown` is updated so that tools reading EXIF will correctly locate the image.

IPTC has many more location parts, including altitude and various region-specific jurisdiction names.

#### 3.1.4.2. Example   <a name="3.1.4.2"></a>

  </Iptc4xmpExt:LocationShown>
 </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>
```

#### 3.1.4.3. Future extensions   <a name="3.1.4.3"></a>

There is a known desire to store location information that IPTC cannot:

- approximate coordinates, with estimates of how approximate they are
- coordinate regions

IPTC does allow location data inside image regions. The complexity of these was deemed too involved for this release, but may be recommended in a future release.

There is a known desire to add structured but versatile place name metadata; an example spec might look like

- an ordered list, from smallest to largest, of
- component names, each containing
- the name (e.g. "New York") and the name of the type of region being named (e.g. "City")
- ... all coupled with an "as of" date

There are multiple other proposals for such historical place hierarchies under consideration.



### 3.1.5. Person Name   <a name="3.1.5"></a>

FHMWG-recommended person name metadata stores people directly depicted in the media; people directly depicted in the media; and people not depicted by who contributed to or were otherwise relevant to the depiction (e.g., a witness of the event such as the photographer, painter, drafter, etc.)
It does not store other people involved in the provenance chain (digitizer, editor, metadata author, etc).

Implementations should assume that each entry is independent and valid unless a user makes a different decision.
Even having multiple regions with the same name is generally permitted as a person may appear in multiple regions of an image (e.g., in a mirror, by having something else occlude part of them, by signing the document in multiple places, etc)
or multiple people may have the same name.

Person Face also stores the name of a person. Because Person Name is more widely supported, it is recommended that applications copy any `mwg-rs:Title` into a `Iptc4xmpExt:PersonInImage`.


#### 3.1.5.1. Other metadata of interest   <a name="3.1.5.1"></a>

IPTC also allows a `Iptc4xmpExt:PersonInImageWDetails` which has much more detail about each person, not just a single name.

Information about people not depicted can be found in many other metadata fields, including but not limited to

- XMP `dc:creator`
- IPTC IIM 2:80 By-Line
- XMP `plus:ImageCreator`
- EXIF 0x13B "Artist"

How and whether to reading these is left up to individual implementations.

#### 3.1.5.2. Example   <a name="3.1.5.2"></a>

```xml
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf='http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'>

  </Iptc4xmpExt:PersonInImage>
 </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>
```

#### 3.1.5.3. Future extensions   <a name="3.1.5.3"></a>

There is a known desire to indicate name parts (given, preferred, family, patronymic, matronymic, honorific, etc).

There is a known desire to indicate relationships between people, familial and otherwise.


### 3.1.6. Person Face   <a name="3.1.6"></a>

Person Face is only for persons depicted in the image. A person that is not in the depiction but is part of the original depiction event, such as a photographer or painter, should use the Person Name instead.

Person Face may be used to mark persons who are visible in the image, but whose faces are not visible. In that case, the region should indicate the most identifiable part of the person.

Because regions are given in relative units to the size of the image, they need to be updated if the image is cropped or padded but do not need to be updated if the image is scaled or resized.

Regions may also extend off the edge of the image; if so, they should be cropped to the image bounds.

Multiple regions may overlap.

Regions do not distinguish between circular and square regions, nor between rectangular and elliptical regions. Each application may decide which to use in displaying regions to the user.

Person Face also stores the name of a person. Because Person Name is more widely supported, it is recommended that applications copy any `mwg-rs:Title` into a `Iptc4xmpExt:PersonInImage`.


#### 3.1.6.1. Other metadata of interest   <a name="3.1.6.1"></a>

IPTC has a separate region specification, `Iptc4xmpExt:ImageRegion`. This is both more flexible and less widely supported.

#### 3.1.6.2. Example   <a name="3.1.6.2"></a>

```xml

</rdf:RDF>
```

#### 3.1.6.3. Future extensions   <a name="3.1.6.3"></a>

There is a known desire to distinguish between "not depicted" and "depicted at an unknown location".





## 3.2. Handling Unicode and Languages   <a name="3.2"></a>

All XMP data is written in Unicode, and use of Unicode-aware programming APIs are recommended.
At a minimum, it is important to know that

- Not all characters occupy the same number of bytes
- Not all glyphs occupy the same number of characters
- Not all identical glyphs have identical character sequences
- Not all adjacent editor cursor positions are one character apart
- Not all parts of text flow in the same direction
- Not all text is properly sorted in code-point order

See [unicode.org](https://home.unicode.org) for more.

All human-readable IPTC strings use AltLang structures to provide a set of alternative presentations in different languages.
Languages are expressed by language tags, as defined in [BCP 47](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt),
which consist of one or more language subtags, as defined in the [IANA Language Subtag Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry),
and can indicate many things about text including language, script, dialect, and more.
The language subtag registry is frequently updated with new languages, but maintained in a way that ensures old tags never lose their meaning.

The quasi-language-tag `x-default` used by XMP

- is optional
- if present, must be the first alternative in the AltLang
- if present, is recommended to have an alternative with the same payload
- is semantically equivalent to the standard tag `und-i-default`: an undetermined language to be shown by default
- is the only tag edited by some generic metadata editing programs

Because of the last point above, it is recommended that `x-default` be used in every AltLang.

As with other metadata, a conformant application must not discard or edit language-tagged data in an AltLang simply because the language is unknown to the application.
Users should be asked to indicate the language in which they are working;
if they do not do so, user-edited values should be given the `x-default` language tag.

It is an error to include the same language tag in an AltLang more than once.

There is no known way to indicate one value as the original language and others as translations thereof.


## 3.3. XML namespaces   <a name="3.3"></a>

XMP is encoded as RDF/XML, and XML uses namespaces to name its elements.
Namespace prefixes used are given in the XML, and are not semanitcally significant.
Thus the following two XMP datasets are semantically identical:

```xml
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf='http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'>
 <rdf:Description xmlns:photoshop='http://ns.adobe.com/photoshop/1.0/'>
  <photoshop:DateCreated>2020-07-16T08:28:17-04:00</photoshop:DateCreated>
 </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>
```

```xml
<RDF xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'>
 <Description xmlns:p='http://ns.adobe.com/p/1.0/'>
  <p:DateCreated>2020-07-16T08:28:17-04:00</p:DateCreated>
 </Description>
</RDF>
```

Despite this, incomplete XML parsers are common that treat namespaces as significant and would fail to parse the second of the above examples.
To maximize compatibility with such systems,
it is recommended to always export data using the default namespaces given in the beginning of [Metadata to Write](#2).

## 3.4. Treating XMP as RDF/XML   <a name="3.4"></a>

XMP is officially [RDF/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/): that is, RDF expressed in XML.
RDF is a very flexible data format, including the ability to encode cyclic graphs and other data that cannot be trivially represented in nested structures.
However, all common XMP vocabularies use tree-structured data that can be represented as nested XML without identifiers and pointers.

Despite this pointer-free simplicity of XMP compared to general RDF/XML, it is unfortunately the case that each of the major XMP processing toolchains uses a slightly different representation of the XMP when writing to a file.
For example,

- some will split the data into several different `rdf:RDF` elements, while others will merge them;
- some will represent an element with `rdf:parseType='Resource'` as an element without that attribute containing a nested `rdf:Description` element;
- some will convert text-valued sub-elements of an `rdf:Description` element into attributes of that element instead

These and other variations in representation are all allowed by RDF/XML, and thus by XMP, without change in the meaning of metadata being represented. Further, many XMP toolchains do not provide the ability for the user to select the representation variation to use during output.

Because of this, metadata parsers should use a fully-compliant RDF/XML parser.
Metadata producers may bypass this by providing the nested XML described in [Metadata to Write], or may produce any equivalent RDF/XML.
If possible, it is recommended that metdata producers match the structure listed above as closely as their XMP toolset allows;
relevant rules to apply in the RDF/XML specification include "omitting blank nodes" and "omitting nodes."

## 3.5. Length Limits   <a name="3.5"></a>

Neither XMP nor IPTC impose any limits on the length of string payloads, and neither does the FHMWG.
Implementations should be prepared to store and display strings of arbitrary lengths.

In particular, [captions](#2.2) often contain many distinct pieces of information in somewhat verbose prose and may extend into tens of thousands of characters or more.

## 3.6. Archival quality <a name="3.6"></a>

It should be noted that this document permits editing metadata in a destructive way (i.e., without preserving its previous content).
It is thus not an archival standard.
However, it is our intent that an implementation can be compliant with both this recommendation
and with archival standards by not permitting users to modify existing metadata.

There is a known desire to add append-only edit logs or other archival-quality metadata editing.
